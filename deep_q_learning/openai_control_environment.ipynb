    "# Practice of Reinforcement Learning using Q learning implemented with Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook constitutes a practice of deep q learning inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79pmNdyxEGo&t=1s&index=17&list=PL2-dafEMk2A7mu0bSksCGMJEmeddU_H4D. The objective is to train an agent to solve the Cart Pole OpenAI's control problem (https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/CartPole-v0). It has been done with two types of agents. The firstone uses the raw pixel of the game besides a Convolutional Neural Network in order to balance the pole. The second approach uses a full conected Neural Netfork with just the information of the simulation provided by the OpenAI library in order to learn how to balance the pole"
